# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is designed to both help practice the new skills, as I develop them, and provide a place
for me to refer back to when I get stuck. 
This will provide me with an easy to access place for all my course notes and links to further resources.

This is the first step in becoming a Front End Web Developer.
